== Introduction

Spring REST Docs Easy makes API documentation simpler and more efficient through automation and internationalization support. It's designed to streamline the documentation process, allowing developers to focus on building great features rather than writing extensive documentation.

== Key Strengths of Spring REST Docs Easy

=== 1. Automated Description Generation

* Automatically reads class structures to generate descriptor objects.
* Greatly simplifies the documentation process.
* Reduces the burden on developers to manually write documentation code.
* Especially useful in environments where data models frequently change.

=== 2. Internationalization Support

* Utilizes internationalization messages to bind descriptions.
* Makes it easier to manage documentation in projects requiring multilingual support.
* Significant advantage for applications targeting global markets.

=== 3. Validation Annotation Handling

* Reads validation annotations defined on class fields.
* Automatically extracts constraints and outputs them based on internationalization message information.
* Automatically defines required and optional fields.
* Enhances the accuracy and efficiency of documentation.

== Practical Example: Documenting a Member List API

Let's dive into a practical example that showcases how Spring REST Docs Easy can streamline your documentation process.

=== Test Code

[source,java]
----
@WebMvcTest(MemberRestController.class)
@AutoConfigureMvcRestDocs
class MemberRestControllerTest {
  @Autowired
  private RestDocs restDocs;

  @Test
  void list() throws Exception {
      mockMvc.perform(get("/members"))
          .andExpect(status().isOk())
          .andDo(document(RESTDOCS_PATH,
              restDocs.generate(MemberResponse.class).responseFields("[].")
                  .andWithPrefix("[].locationAddress.", restDocs.generate(LocationAddress.class).toField())
          ));
  }
}
----

=== What's Happening Behind the Scenes

1. *Automatic Field Discovery*: The library scans the `MemberResponse` class and its nested `LocationAddress` class, identifying all fields and their types.

2. *Smart Prefixing*: The `andWithPrefix("[].locationAddress.", ...)` part intelligently handles nested objects in your response, ensuring clear and accurate documentation of complex structures.

3. *Validation Integration*: If you've used validation annotations in your model classes, Spring REST Docs Easy will automatically include this information in the generated documentation.

4. *Internationalization Support*: The library can use i18n messages for field descriptions, making it easy to create multilingual documentation.

=== Generated Documentation

==== Sample Request

[source,http]
----
GET /members HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
----

==== Sample Response

[source,http]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 3265

[ {
  "id" : 699,
  "name" : "Name_wusha",
  "age" : 81,
  "job" : "ENGINEER",
  "email" : "email_bdifzyt@example.com",
  "active" : true,
  "tags" : [ "tag_urx", "tag_rvq", "tag_pta", "tag_jtp" ],
  "locationAddress" : {
    "address" : "Street_yhgux",
    "detailAddress" : "City_yrbqp",
    "zipCode" : "Country_lzuzr"
  }
}, { ....
----

== Benefits for Developers

1. *Time-Saving*: No more manual writing of API docs. The library does the heavy lifting.
2. *Accuracy*: Documentation is generated directly from your code, reducing discrepancies between docs and actual implementation.
3. *Maintainability*: As your API evolves, your documentation automatically stays up-to-date.
4. *Internationalization*: Easy support for multiple languages without duplicating effort.
5. *Integration with Existing Tools*: Works seamlessly with Spring REST Docs, leveraging its power while simplifying its use.

== Conclusion

Spring REST Docs Easy supports developers in performing API documentation more efficiently and reliably through its key strengths. It offers significant advantages, particularly in projects with frequent data model changes or those requiring multilingual support. By using Spring REST Docs Easy, you can turn the chore of API documentation into a breeze, allowing you to focus more on building great features and less on documenting them.
