= Spring REST Docs Easy

Spring REST Docs Easy makes API documentation simpler and more efficient through automation and internationalization support.

**Key Strengths of Spring REST Docs Easy**

1. **Automated Description Generation**:
- Automatically reads class structures to generate descriptor objects, greatly simplifying the documentation process. This reduces the burden on developers to manually write documentation code, making it especially useful in environments where data models frequently change.
2. **Internationalization Support**:
- Utilizes internationalization messages to bind descriptions, making it easier to manage documentation in projects that require multilingual support. This is a significant advantage for applications targeting global markets.
3. **Validation Annotation Handling**:
- Reads validation annotations defined on class fields to automatically extract constraints and outputs them based on internationalization message information. It also automatically defines required and optional fields, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of documentation.

Spring REST Docs Easy supports developers in performing API documentation more efficiently and reliably through these strengths. It offers significant advantages, particularly in projects with frequent data model changes or those requiring multilingual support.
